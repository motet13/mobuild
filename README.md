# mobuild

  First of all, I called it mobuild becuase my name is Moses and the purpose of this project is to build and configure my machine into my personal needs. I often forget to install packages to my computer so I have decided to make a script from scratch to make my life easier.
  
# How does it work?
  
  The idea is to check if wanted packages are installed to my machine. If not, then install it. The program will output a result letting me know what is installed or what is not installed. The program also has the ability to configure my .vimrc file, this includes installing Vudle.vim - a vim plugin manger, configuring vundle.vim within .vimrc, and downloading my favorite vim colorshemes.
